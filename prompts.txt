Based on the schema, I want you to start the database.schema file from scratch, and test the migrations for each test case defined in the todo-test.md file in the database.

Do one migration at a time, name the migration the same as the test case (example extensions_test_installation_of_pgcrypto), then run migrate:up and migrate:down to test if it is working properly.

For each test, keep the previous model and add more cases because we want to see how the interaction between the changes will work.

The final goal is to test if the migrations are ready to run on the real database.

We are working on an ORM, so you need to modify the code that generates this migration. Do not modify the migration directly.

Migrations must always follow the sequence, and if one goes wrong, after correcting the code that generates it, you must delete it and generate a new one in its place to continue testing.

Before correcting anything, detect the error and explain it to me in detail so that we can agree together on how to solve it.

Some migrations have already been tested, so start where we left off.

after each successful migration commit it and go to the next test.
